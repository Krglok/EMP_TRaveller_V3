# This file can contain two lists: one with elevated players with special permissions
# and one with banned players.

# 'Id' is a SteamID64 in both lists, lookup possible at https://steamid.io/
# 'Permission' is 3 for 'GameMaster', 6 for 'Moderator' and 9 for 'Admin' - other values are not allowed.
# 'Until' is the time when the ban ends.

Elevated:
- Id: 76561198372649550 # put the correct SteamID64 here
  Permission: 9         # make this user a GameMaster, for example
- Id: 76561198072429511
  Permission: 3
